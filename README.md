## My process

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS
- SASS
- PixelParallel by htmlBurger chrome extension for pixel perfect comparison
- CSS reset by https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/

### What I learned

While doing this task, I found out that inset box-shadow doesn't work on an image. I had to add an image as a background and apply a box shadow on the element. May be there is a better way to handle it?



### Continued development

responsive design, sass, learn react and start using it in exercises
